No deal yet in Senate as debt-ceiling talks stall
### Senate Republicans, Democrats Fail To Break Spending Stalemate

Senate Republicans and Democrats hit an impasse Sunday over spending in their last-ditch struggle to avoid an economy-jarring default in just four days and end a partial government shutdown that's entering its third week.

After inconclusive talks between President [Barack Obama](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama) and House Republicans, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., took charge in trying to end the crises, although a conversation Sunday afternoon failed to break the stalemate.

"I'm optimistic about the prospects for a positive conclusion to the issues before this country today," Reid said as the Senate wrapped up a rare Sunday session.

The two cagy negotiators are at loggerheads over Democratic demands to:

* Undo or 
* Change the automatic, across-the-board spending cuts to domestic and defense programs that the GOP see as crucial to reducing the nation's deficit.
