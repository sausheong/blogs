A sample blog post
A blog post is a way to communicate your thoughts and ideas with associated images or videos. It is also a great way to engage your site visitors by allowing comments on your posts. A blog (a contraction of the words web log) is a discussion or informational site published on the World Wide Web and consisting of discrete entries ("posts") typically displayed in reverse chronological order (the most recent post appears first). Until 2009 blogs were usually the work of a single individual, occasionally of a small group, and often covered a single subject. More recently "multi-author blogs" (MABs) have developed, with posts written by large numbers of authors and professionally edited.
