# A Tale of Two Frameworks

Implementing the same blog web application with 2 differently styled server-side frameworks.

* Framework 1 - Minimalist (Haml + Sinatra + Sequel + Postgres)
* Framework 2 - Alternative (Mustache + Cuba + Mongoid + MongoDB)

## Blog web application user stories

1. As an owner, I want to write blog posts such that they can be read by anyone.
2. As an owner, I want to allow only myself and selected writers to write blog posts.
3. As an owner or writer I want to be able to delete my own posts.
4. As an owner or writer I want to be able to modify my own posts.
5. As a reader, I want to read blog posts.
6. As a reader, I want to comment on a post.
7. As a reader I want to be able to delete my own comments.
8. As a user (owner, writer or reader) I want to be able to write freely without any technical syntax so that I can concentrate on my writing.
